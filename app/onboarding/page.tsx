/**
 * Onboarding is a ONE-TIME step per profile. Fresh sign-ups flow here from
 * /login; anyone whose profile is already complete is redirected to the student
 * dashboard (/dashboard/student) smoothly without flickering or exposing the
 * form — including candidates who arrive here via the browser Back button, a
 * bookmark, or a direct URL.
 *
 * The DB is the preferred source of truth for "already onboarded?" (a
 * deleted-and-recreated Supabase account leaves a complete profile in
 * localStorage, and trusting that cache is exactly what bounced the fresh
 * account straight to the dashboard). But when the live account matches the
 * cached one, a completed cached profile is trusted too, so a flaky network
 * can never bounce a finished candidate back into the wizard.
 *
 * Completing the form during this visit does NOT trigger the redirect — the
 * wizard's own "Profile saved" overlay takes the user to the resume step.
