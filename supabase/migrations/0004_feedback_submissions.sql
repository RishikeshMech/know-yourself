-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0004 — candidate feedback (`feedback_submissions`)
-- Run in the Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push`). Idempotent.
--
-- "Which candidate gave which feedback": until now the post-assessment
-- feedback form posted straight to Formspree and nothing was stored in our own
-- database, so the admin dashboard could not show it. The app now writes every
-- submission here (and mirrors it into the local JSON store so demo mode still
-- works), and /admin reads it back per student.
--
-- Notes on the shape:
--   * `student_id` is nullable: the seeded/demo candidates carry short `u_…`
--     ids that cannot be stored in a `uuid` column, so the raw id is kept in
--     `student_ref` and the email is stored too. The dashboard matches feedback
--     to a student by id **or** email, so both cases work.
--   * `session_id` is text (assessment session ids are UUIDs for real sessions
--     but `sess_…` for the demo data).
--   * inserts are allowed for anyone (it is a feedback form, like a contact
--     form); reads are self-scoped and the admin reads with the service role.

alter table public.feedback_submissions enable row level security;

-- Anyone (including the anon key the app uses when no service role is set) may
-- submit feedback; the CHECK constraints above still apply.
drop policy if exists feedback_insert_any on public.feedback_submissions;
create policy feedback_insert_any on public.feedback_submissions
  for insert with check (true);

-- A signed-in student may read back their own feedback.
drop policy if exists feedback_select_own on public.feedback_submissions;
create policy feedback_select_own on public.feedback_submissions
  for select using (student_id = auth.uid());

-- ============================================================================
-- Optional convenience: expose the latest feedback on the export view so a
-- plain `select * from public.student_profiles_full` also carries it. The app
-- does NOT depend on this — /admin joins feedback itself (so it works whether
-- or not this migration has been applied) — but it keeps the SQL view useful
-- for manual exports. Skipped automatically when migration 0003 has not run.
